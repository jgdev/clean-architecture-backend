# Arithmetic Calculator REST API

Implement a Web platform to provide a simple calculator functionality (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, square root, and a random string generation) where each functionality will
have a separate cost per request.

User’s will have a starting credit/balance. Each request will be deducted from the user’s balance.
If the user’s balance isn’t enough to cover the request cost, the request shall be denied.

This Web application and its UI application should be live (on any platform of your choice). They
should be ready to be configured and used locally for any other developer (having all instructions
written for this purpose).

## Features

- User login
- User logout
- New operation
- List operations (filter/search, sorted with pagination)
- Delete records (soft-delete)
